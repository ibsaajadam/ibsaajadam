### Hi there, I am Ibsaa Jamal Adam ðŸ‘‹

## My main passions are personal development and entrepreneurship.

### Ever since I was a kid I loved entrepreneurship and helping others. I stumbled across web development after I needed money on break from college and started a dog walking business. When customers wanted a way to book my services and for me to send them invoices I was soon introduced to Adobe Dreamweaver and web development.

What I am doing now:

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... creating anything!
